## 2025-05-15 - [Form Accessibility and Actionable Contact Links]
**Learning:** In landing pages with limited interaction, micro-UX improvements like making static contact information (Email/WhatsApp) actionable and ensuring form accessibility provide significant value with minimal logic change.
**Action:** Always ensure form inputs are associated with `<Label>` components and have appropriate ARIA attributes for validation errors. Wrap contact details in relevant `mailto:` or messaging platform links (e.g., `https://wa.me/`).
