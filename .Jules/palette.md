## 2025-05-12 - Form Accessibility via Screen-Reader-Only Labels
**Learning:** In visually minimalist designs where placeholders are used as labels, adding `<Label>` elements with the `sr-only` class ensures accessibility for screen readers while maintaining the original UI aesthetic. Proper association between label `htmlFor` and input `id` is crucial for reliable automated testing and accessibility.
**Action:** Always include hidden labels for form inputs that only use placeholders to satisfy both design and accessibility requirements.

## 2025-05-13 - Smooth and Accessible Navigation Patterns
**Learning:** For animated mobile menus, combining `AnimatePresence` with `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` creates a cohesive experience for all users. Adding `focus-visible` rings with `rounded-md` and `transition-all` ensures keyboard navigation is visually clear and consistent with the site's design language.
**Action:** Always synchronize ARIA states with animation lifecycles and ensure all interactive elements in the navigation have explicit focus states.

## 2025-05-14 - Expanding Focus Targets Without Layout Shifts
**Learning:** For text-based links in dense areas like footers, using small horizontal padding combined with matching negative margins (e.g., `px-1 -ml-1`) allows for larger, more accessible focus rings and hit targets without displacing the text or disrupting the visual alignment.
**Action:** Apply the padding/negative-margin pattern to small text links to improve keyboard accessibility while preserving the intended UI rhythm.
